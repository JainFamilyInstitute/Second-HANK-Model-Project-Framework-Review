function [c_guess, inc]=policyguess(meshes,WW,RBRB,par,mpar)
%policyguess returns autarky policy guesses (in the first period only):
% c_a_guess, c_n_guess, psi_guess
% as well as income matrices later on used in EGM:
% inc
%
% Consumption is compositite leisure and physical consumption (x_it) in the
% paper, therefore labor income is reduced by the fraction of leisure
% consumed.
